# kinect-boids
EOH 2015 project for SIGMusic

## Requirements
1. processing: https://processing.org/
2. kinect v2 SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561
3. sound: TBD

## Idea
The idea behind this project is to create an exhibit where anyone can walk in and start interacting to create music. 
It shouldn't be hard for anyone to see how their actions affect the kinds of sounds that are being made. 
Boids (bird-oids) are an idea from the graphics realm where there are these bird like polygons that interact with each other to continuously fly throughout the simulation. The Kinect will be able to interact with these boids, while each one (or flock) carries a sound synthesizer based on different attributes.
